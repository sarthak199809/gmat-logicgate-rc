1,The Basics of Supply and Demand,Very Easy,"Supply and demand is a fundamental concept in economics. When the price of a product goes up, suppliers want to produce more of it. At the same time, consumers usually want to buy less of it because it is more expensive.

This interaction creates a balance in the market. If there is too much of a product, the price will likely drop until people start buying it again. If there is too little, the price will rise until the supply catches up with the demand.

Understanding these simple forces helps businesses decide what to sell and how much to charge. It also helps governments understand how taxes might affect the behavior of buyers and sellers."
2,The Evolution of Mammals,Easy,"Mammals began to diversify significantly after the extinction of the dinosaurs about 66 million years ago. Before this, early mammals were mostly small, nocturnal creatures that lived in the shadows of larger reptiles.

Once the dinosaurs were gone, new ecological niches became available. Mammals quickly evolved into a wide variety of forms, from tiny shrews to massive whales. This process is known as adaptive radiation.

Today, mammals are found in almost every environment on Earth. Their success is attributed to several key traits, including warm blood, hair, and the ability to nurse their young, which allowed them to survive in climates where reptiles struggled."
3,The Industrial Revolution & Labor,Medium,"The Industrial Revolution, which peaked in the mid-19th century, fundamentally altered the economic landscape of Western Europe. While it brought about unprecedented growth in production, it also introduced significant challenges for the laboring classes.

Many historians argue that the rise of factories led to a decline in the quality of life for workers. These scholars point to evidence of overcrowded housing and poor sanitation in urban centers.

However, recent research suggests a more nuanced picture. Some economists contend that real wages actually rose during this period, despite the visible urban squalor.

Furthermore, advancements in manufacturing technology eventually led to shorter working hours and safer environments by the late 19th century. This transition, though slow, indicates a progressive improvement.

Ultimately, the debate remains complex. One cannot simply categorize the era as purely exploitative or purely beneficial without considering the long-term structural shifts in the global economy."
4,Quantum entanglement and Locality,Medium-Hard,"Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one instantly influences the state of the other, regardless of distance. This 'spooky action at a distance,' as Einstein called it, challenges our classical understanding of locality.

In a classical system, information cannot travel faster than the speed of light. However, entanglement suggests that at a fundamental level, the universe may be non-local. Experiments have consistently confirmed that entangled particles behave as a single entity.

This has profound implications for the future of communication and computing. Quantum teleportation, for example, relies on entanglement to transmit information between locations, though it does not technically violate the speed-of-light limit for useful data.

Despite these successes, a complete theoretical reconciliation between quantum mechanics and general relativity remains elusive. The non-local nature of entanglement is one of the primary hurdles in developing a unified 'Theory of Everything'."
5,Antibiotic Resistance,Hard,"The rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria poses one of the most significant threats to modern medicine. Penicillin, once hailed as a miracle drug, is now ineffective against numerous strains of common pathogens.

Current medical strategy relies heavily on the development of new synthetic compounds. Yet, the pace of drug discovery has slowed significantly over the past two decades, leading to a 'discovery void.'

To combat this, some researchers are revisiting bacteriophage therapy—the use of viruses to kill bacteria. This approach was largely abandoned in the West after the advent of antibiotics but is now gaining renewed interest.

Preliminary studies indicate that phages can be highly specific, targeting only the harmful bacteria while sparing the beneficial microbiome. This specificity could overcome the broad-spectrum limitations of traditional antibiotics.

Nevertheless, the regulatory hurdles for phage therapy are immense. Because each phage is unique, standardizing treatment protocols within existing frameworks remains a daunting task."
